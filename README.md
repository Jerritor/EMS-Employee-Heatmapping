# EMS-Employee-Heatmapping

### WARNING: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT USE THESE HEATMAPS FOR ANY MEANINGFUL DECISIONS. THESE MAPS WERE MADE WITH HIGHLY INNACURATE DATA WITH A LOT OF PREDICTIONS MADE TO FILL IN THE GAPS. My final report will contain instructions on how to replicate the same procedure on data that is properly collected.

### How to View Maps
Download and open the html files.

### How to View the Riders Heatmap with All Barangays
Open the 'ridermappingv2.ipynb' file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all the code in order. The HTML file was too big for github to manually import.
